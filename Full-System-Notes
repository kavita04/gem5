Here are some notes for how full-system simulation was achieved.

1) Began with Jason's excellent blog post on setting up gem5 full system.
http://www.lowepower.com/jason/setting-up-gem5-full-system.html

2) Created an ubuntu 16.04 disk image and kernel binary hopefully still here-
/u/s/w/swapnilh/private/2017_FOMA/gem5-FS-files/

3) Use the linux kernel from here-
https://github.com/swapnilh/linux

4) Following instructions from 1 above, gem5init should be in /sbin/.
We invoke this script on login through the root's bashrc file.
----------- /root/.bashrc ------------
# If not running interactively, don't do anything
[ -z "$PS1" ] && return

/sbin/gem5init   // <-- New line added

5) To login automatically without being prompted for the password,
we use the serial getty service
-----------  /lib/systemd/system/serial-getty@.service -------------
// Add autologin root flags to the commandline as shown below
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --autologin root --keep-baud 115200,38400,9600 %I $TERM

6) To avoid multiple terminals being launched, comment out ExecStart 
from debug-shell service
-----------  /lib/systemd/system/debug-shell.service -------------
#ExecStart=/bin/bash // <- Line commented out
